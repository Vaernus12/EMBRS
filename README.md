# EMBRS Forged
Powered by the $EMBRS token, EMBRS Forged is a platform that is used to launch games from independent studios within the XRP Ledger. Studios will be able to easily add support for features ranging from Play-To-Earn, to supporting functional economies via selling items, land, and properties in-game as NFTs.

## Website
- [EMBRS Platform](https://emberlight.quarteroniongames.com/platform/)

## TESTING Phase (Activated)
Testing focuses on our currently active [Discord](https://discord.gg/quarteronion) bot which is allowing us to experiment with features that will exist in Core. Currently this includes earning via the EMBRS faucet, rewarding players in the Emberlight tournament, and tipping other community members. We will continue to test other features while building the Core web app.

### Proof Of Concept Game (Launched)
- [Emberlight](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1048880/Emberlight/)

### Current Features
- Daily faucet earning EMBRS
- Weekly Emberlight tournament earning EMBRS
- XRPL DEX swaps between EMBRS/XRP, EMBRS/USD, and USD/XRP trading pairs
- Community tipping of EMBRS

## CORE Phase (QUARTER 2, 2023)
Core focuses on Play-To-Earn. This phase will have the biggest impact on both game developers and players. Players can begin earning in their favorite games while developers require very minimal changes to their game’s code to support this.

### Proof Of Concept Game (In Development)
- [Emberlight: Rekindled](https://emberlight.quarteroniongames.com/game/)

### Expected Features
- Game distribution (either as a patch or full game via IPFS)
- Play-To-Earn Module accessible by developers via API (games can access API to reward players in EMBRS or their own tokens)
- Web platform and downloadable app (app required for game distribution)
- Expansion of testing XRPL DEX swaps to allow swapping between EMBRS and each game's currency or token

## EXPANSION Phase (QUARTER 4, 2023)
Expansion focuses on features which enhance Play-To-Earn while providing more tools for both the community and game developers. Players can now earn NFTs from Steam achievements and dabble in E-Sports via tournaments. Game developers find new tools such as an asset database to help facilitate game production and further tap into the power of the XRP Ledger.

### Expected Features
- Community hub to allow easier interactions between players and developers
- E-Sports Module accessible by developers via API (coordinating tournaments and rewarding players)

## ECONOMY Phase (QUARTER 3, 2025)
Economy focuses on NFTs empowering functional economies. Games and metaverses can utilize the Economy module to allow players to earn via interacting with the world’s economy. This can range from running a business to selling off loot, with the items, land, and properties being NFTs that have real world value.

### Proof Of Concept Game (Pre-production)

### Expected Features
- Economy Module accessible by developers via API (utilizing NFTs for businesses, characters, items, land, property, etc. to simulate a functional economy)
- Showcase Module accessible by developers via API (NFT creators can allow curation of their assets within games and metaverses such as in an art gallery or museum)
